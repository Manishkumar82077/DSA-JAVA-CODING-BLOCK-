# Java DSA

This repository contains my basic Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice from my first and second semesters.  
It includes simple Java programs and DSA problems that I solved while learning core Java concepts and problem-solving fundamentals.

This repository reflects my initial learning phase in Java and DSA.
